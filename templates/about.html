                    platform that makes it possible to rent a house without paying any brokerage<br/>Rent A Port was
                    started because all of us believed that paying hefty brokerage can not be the only option to find a
                    new home. As tenants, we have been paying these brokerages year on year without seeing any advantage
                    of the broker. The only reason he existed was that there was a huge information asymmetry in the
                    market. Rent A Port is a platform that removes this information asymmetry and provides a marketplace
                    for free exchange of this information that used to cost 1-2 months of rent as brokerage.</p>
